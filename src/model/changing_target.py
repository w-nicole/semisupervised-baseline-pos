# Referenced/modified code from Shijie Wu's crosslingual-nlp repository,
#   particularly `model/tagger.py`.
# Taken code includes basic class structure, imports, and method headers,
# general method logic for all methods that also exist in `tagger.py`,
#   excluding new functionality per new decoder logic/irrelevant old functionality
#   as well as inheritance-related code (such as the declaration of the argparse)
#   or code that directly overrides previous code
#  (like the mix_sampling default value,
#  the logic of the forward/training_step code was maintained with irrelevant code removed, with new logic added)  
#  Most other code was added.
# See LICENSE in this codebase for license information.
